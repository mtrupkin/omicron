Welcome to Omicron: Assault

Space station Omicron was built on the far edges of explored space.
It was meant as base for further exploration into the galaxy.

The first expedition launched from Omicron never returned.
Soon afterwards, communication with Omicron itself was lost.

Your Star Law patrol vessel, being the only presence in this region of space, 
was called to investigate.

While on board Omicron, you are immediately attacked by Zellan forces.
